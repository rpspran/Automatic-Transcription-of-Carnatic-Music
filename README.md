# Automatic-Transcription-of-Carnatic-Music
Automatic transcriptions of various segments of a small Carnatic piece (Indian Classical music piece)

My Contribution:
- The mathematics behind the algorithms, and the MATLAB code files were developed by Dr. Venkata Subramanian Viraraghavan.
- I worked on developing the Python Code equivalents for the MATLAB codes, with the aid of SMOP Small MATLAB and Ocatave to Python Converter (https://github.com/victorlei/smop)". I first designed a Function Call Tree (Function Call Tree.xlsx) and then compared the outputs stage-by-stage of the MATLAB and Python files, and endeavored towards creating PYTHON file equivalents. The work is still in progress.
- In essence, a contribution to the Backend of the webpage https://www.iitm.ac.in/donlab/Music_Project/cm_transcription/ was done by me. 

Description:
Carnatic Music is comprised of "gamakas" or ornamentations which are difficult to capture in a written musical notation. This particular project attempts to perform the detailed transcription of Carnatic Music. This is a process in which once a musical recording is uploaded, the pitch curves of it are generated graphically. There are two components of the pitch curves - "Constant Pitch-Notes" - the regions where the pitch is constant and "Transients" - the regions where the pitch changes abruptly. The detailed steps of the algorithms are provided in the Slidepack_for_CompMusic2022_Workshop.pdf. The link to a Youtube video that demonstrates this - https://youtu.be/OtCqTmmAzvM.

In the website, https://www.iitm.ac.in/donlab/Music_Project/swara_correction/ (the following page after entering the details, wherein a graph is displayed), the green color sections signify regions of "Constant Pitch" while the red color sections signify the "Transients".
